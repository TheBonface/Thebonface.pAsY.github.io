## PasY(Physical Addressing System)

PaSy (physical addressing system) has been designed and developed for the main purpose of creating a web based physical addressing system.
It is intended to spearhead the open research and development of open source Physical addressing system with the hope for creating a community of contributors to the code base, everyone deserves to own an address hence the motivation for developing the system.
## Why Pasy
Four billion people are excluded from the rule of law, as the lack of a legal identity often prevents them from enjoying their rights as citizens. Setting up an addressing system is the first step towards tackling this issue.  PaSy(physical addressing system ) is  a web based  System  that assigns an address to properties using a Geo-reference system giving physical identity and location to properties using , geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude), plot Number, county, country , street name , door number and zip code. 

The project is fueled by the fact that Inaccurate and unreliable location address has financial and human cost implications, particularly in dispatch of inter-alia, police and other security services as well as fire and ambulance services in emergency situations. Ruby has been used as the programming language and Ruby on rails as the MVC web framework of choice. The system contains modules such as details authentication , security, location address generator , map module and  a central database which stores the user and location information, it is queried and updated appropriately.  The system has been designed and developed as an open source project due to its magnitude, this is the official project repository.
