Setting up an addressing system is the first step towards tackling this issue.  PaSy(physical addressing system ) is  a web based  System  that assigns an address to properties using a Geo-reference system giving physical identity and location to properties using , geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude), plot Number, county, country , street name , door number and zip code. \r\n\r\nThe project is fueled by the fact that Inaccurate and unreliable location address has financial and human cost implications, particularly in dispatch of inter-alia, police and other security services as well as fire and ambulance services in emergency situations. Ruby has been used as the programming language and Ruby on rails as the MVC web framework of choice. The system contains modules such as details authentication , security, location address generator , map module and  a central database which stores the user and location information, it is queried and updated appropriately.  The system has been designed and developed as an open source project due to its magnitude, this is the official project repository. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Things you may want to cover:\r\n\r\n",
